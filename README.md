## Motivation

> ðŸ‘‰ Accompanying blog post:
[The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to CLI Apps in V](https://blog.vlang.io/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-cli-apps-in-v/).

This project is meant to be a demonstration showcasing how
easy it is to make a good CLI application with V. There is
also an example to how to effectively structure a V
project with modules and conduct unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Instructions for installing the V language can be found
[here](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md#install-from-source).
For a brief introduction to V, refer the article:
[Getting Started with V](https://blog.vlang.io/getting-started-with-v/).

Make sure to do `v up` to download and update to the latest version of V.
## Usage

You can use `v run . [OPTIONS]` to run the tool while
developing it. If you want a production build, you can use `v -prod .`, which will generate a binary file `geo` (or `geo.exe` on Windows) at the root of the repository.

To get started, try `./geo --help`. It will print the
following usage guide:

```
geo 0.1.x
-----------------------------------------------
Usage: geo [options] [ARGS]

Description: A sample CLI app for printing geometric shapes to the terminal.

Options:
  -p, --shape <string>      The shape to use for the geometry.
                            Allowed shapes are: left-triangle, right-triangle, pyramid, square, diamond
  -z, --size <int>          The size parameter for the shapes.
  -m, --symbol <string>     The symbol to use for the geometry.
  -h, --help                display this help and exit
  --version                 output version information and exit
```
